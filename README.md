# nobelPrize
is a dynamic web application designed to retrieve data about Nobel laureates from the years 1901-1905. The application fetches the data dynamically from the [NobelAPI](https://api.nobelprize.org/2.1/nobelPrizes) based on the selected year. This project served as an introduction to `TypeScript` for me, while also allowing me to deepen my understanding of `React Router` and `React Query`. Additionally, the project was an opportunity to explore and test the capabilities of the `MaterialUI` library.
